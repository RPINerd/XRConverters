- fmt_DKOnline_xac.py

    is a for xrebirth modified .xac file reader python script plugin for noesis. It's not coded by me.
    I found it in the internet and modified it that it can open more of the .xac's


- XRebirthCatUnpack.exe

    XRebirth Cat file extractor. It opens a window when starting and it should be simple enough to figure out what to do then.


- XRebirthCatUnpackSources.zip   

    The C# visual studio express 2010 project sources for the XRebirth Cat file extractor. Note that I hacked this thing in very little time at the day of the game release.


- XACDAEConverterProjectVers0point12.zip

    The XAC to DAE and DAE to XAC converter project. I dropped it. There is no more to come. If you want to pick the project up you can. (maybe let me know)
    Someone with the nick arc_ on the egosoft froum did a truely unbelievable Job in reverse engineereing and extracting the .xac file format specs next to other files.
    More informations can be found in the Egosoft Forum's Thread [Research/Tool] The .XAC to .DAE Converter Project http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=358573
    I still think the best or simplest is to merge the DAE meshes into existig game.xac's


- YishasAlternativeBody.zip

    Yisha has a second body in the game. It's a complete body with mesh and texture and everything is set up in the game already. This mod just activates it.
    It does no entry in your game save file so it can be simple deactivated and activated whenever you please in any game.
    Extract the content into your xrebirth extensions folder:  \Steam\steamapps\common\X Rebirth\extensions. If you still have no extension folder create it.
   
    It should look like this when done:
    \Steam\steamapps\common\X Rebirth\extensions\YishasAlternativeBody\assets 
    \Steam\steamapps\common\X Rebirth\extensions\YishasAlternativeBody\content.xml

    The mod is automatical read abd active when you start up the game again.


- YishaFaceV1_2.zip

    Experimental quick overwork of Yisha's Face textures. Attempt to break the extrea color saturation and specular and occlusion overshoot. It comes with her alternative body
